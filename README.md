# Quick Description

**Programmers :shipit:**: [José Angel Morell](https://github.com/jamorell?tab=repositories) and Zakaria Abdelmoiz DAHI from the University of Malaga, Spain. 

**About:** This repositiory implements a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm devised in [1] for optimising communication overhed in federated learning.

## **How :green_book:** 

- I am hosting three version of the proposed approach. Although, [José Angel Morell](https://github.com/jamorell?tab=repositories) and I did not had the time to clean it, and factorise it. Will do it soon!


## **Folders Hiearchy :open_file_folder:**
    
    - Code:
        - V1: the first version of the code.
        - V2: the second version of the code.
        - V3: the third version of the code.
    - Results:
        - This section will be filled once the code is factorised.
